== Requirements
* Require Redmine 2.1.0 higher.
* Recommend Hudson 1.313.

== Feature
=== Show Job List
Show job details.

* Name, Description, Latest Build ( Build number, Result, Date ) and health report.
* You can change description visibility dynamically.
* Provide a link to Hudson, if plugin found keyword in Health Report.
* Bulid number linked to build result page.
* Download artifacts.
* Click clock-icon, request hudson to build.
* Mr. hudson appears. ( sorry, not emotional )
* You can get job list by Atom.

=== Show Build History
Click note icon, show build history.

* build number, result, date.
* Bulid number linked to build result page.
* Console icon linked to console page.

=== Show build history on activity

* jobname, build number, test-result(only number of items) and changesets.

=== Show build result on issue

* job-name, build-number, result and built date and time. when Hudson builds revisions associated issues.

=== Search issues related particular build

You can search issues related job and build using filter.
Plugin chases issues by taking following step.
 Hudson Job -> Hudson Build -> Related Changeset -> Revision -> Issue
Hudson Build and Related Changeset are too much, so plugin limits number of Builds and Changesets per each Hudson Job.
You can change limit settings on settings/plugin/redmine_hudson.

=== Rake task 'redmine_hudson:fetch'

You can get build results using rake task 'redmine_hudson:fetch'.
If you use rake task, please uncheck 'AutoFetch' setting.
You can change 'AutoFetch' setting on settings/plugin/redmine_hudson.

=== Clean up stored data

You can delete old data ( builds, changesets, test results ).
Settings are like Hudson.

* rotate days ( 1day = keep today's data )
* rotate nums

=== Settings for each projects

* Hudson url (can use https)
User can specify url separately, for plugin access and user access.
* auth user, password ( 0.1.1 higher )
* can stop plugin getting test results and changesets. (Getting test results and changesets needs a good amount of time.)
* choose job
* compact mode ( show only job name and latest build)
* keyword and url for health report

=== Settings for plugins (all projects)

Go  Administration -> Plugins -> 'Redmine Hudson Plugin' Configure.

* You can choose format to write job description. HTML or Textile.
* AutoFetch Mode. Plugin fetches information from Hudson during action 'index'.
* Number of Builds per each Hudson Job. ( for search issues )
* Number of Changesets per each Hudson Job. ( for search issues )

But, If plugin fail, never get test results, changesets again.

Plugin has no exclusive control, so plugin doesn't work when redmine works on multi-process.

you should try to delete data from database.
Use 'delete history' button in setting page.
